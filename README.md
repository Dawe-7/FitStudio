# FitStudio

### Welcome to FitStudio
Fit Studio is an augmented reality shopping application which will be used by both physical and online wearables stores

Both physical boutique stores and online wearables shops face the same problem which is window shopping by customers. This happens due to a number of reasons mainly known to the customer but the common factor is indecisiveness. 

Most customers also choose to shop these items online and pandemics such as the COVID-19 proved the need for a smarter way of shopping. 
Therefore, there is a need for customers to try on/explore several different items sold in the shops without having to be at the store physically. To implement this, Fit Studioâ€™s augmented shopping application will allow users to interact with the items. 

They will be able to try on the AR clothing and shoes, find their perfect fit, color and once they are done, they can buy the items with the click of a button.
